This website is built using React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion, with custom CSS animations and gradient styling. It's deployed via GitHub Pages. While the site displays perfectly on Edge and Firefox, Chrome may render it at 50% scale by default, so if you're using Chrome, please zoom out to 50% for the best experience.

This is a personal portfolio where I share my passions both inside and outside of work, along with some fun features. Youâ€™ll also find my resume and contact information if you'd like to reach out.
Thanks for visiting!
