This website is built using React, TypeScript, and Framer Motion, with custom CSS animations and gradient styling. It's deployed via GitHub Pages.

This is a personal portfolio where I share my passions both inside and outside of work, along with some fun features. Youâ€™ll also find my resume and contact information if you'd like to reach out.
Thanks for visiting!
